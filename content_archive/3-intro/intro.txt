  quote: >
    We may consider the dependence on manual
    work either as unfortunate and
    antiquated, or as unavoidable, and even
    fortunate; it will remain a necessity as

    recognized. It will continue until
    building has achieved such final
    development as has been reached, for
    example, by the bicycle.
