    What was your decisive motivation for
    self-employment?
  category: Working Method
  antwort: |
    KW:&nbsp;After studying, we both had a lot of internship experience and realized that we often did not enjoy the working methods of others. You are dependent on someone who structures his enterprise according to his own rules, which you cannot comply with. We both have a vision of how we want to work and deal with each other ­ we have not found that in the Berlin creative industry.
    JD:&nbsp;There is this dichotomy where you want to work. Either one goes into the advertisement and earns appropriate money—but the work is mostly unsatisfactory. Or you go to a cool graphic office, where you gain, despite working extra hours, 900 €. Already during our bachelor studies, we noticed that we are a good team, so there was this idea to become self-employed.
    KW:&nbsp;Our profession is not a high risk. Everyone has a computer and the programs and it is possible to work from anywhere. Even if it does not work, you have not made a big loss.

    How long did it take to become
    independent?
  category: Spezifisch
  antwort: 'KW:&nbsp;From six months up to a year. As a beginner, right after your studies, you are often selling yourself under value. Then you gradually increase the hourly rate and it gets better and better. Generally speaking, there is still space for improvement.'

    Ihr habt erwähnt, dass euch bestimmte
    Abläufe in Agenturen nicht gefallen.
  frage: >
    How do you typically work on your
    projects?
  category: Processes
  antwort: |
    KW:&nbsp;Mittlerweile laufen Projekte recht ähnlich ab, aber bis dahin war es ein langer Prozess. Wenn wir eine Anfrage für ein Projekt erhalten, versuchen wir zusammen mit dem/der Kund_in ein Briefing zu erstellen und entwickeln dann zu zweit das Konzept. Sobald es an die visuelle Umsetzung geht, arbeiten wir getrennt daran weiter. Früher haben wir das zusammen gemacht – was schön war, aber mittlerweile können wir uns das nicht mehr leisten. Das ist aber in Ordnung, weil sich diejenige, die am Projekt arbeitet, verwirklichen kann und die andere sich nur noch bis zu einem gewissen Grad einmischt.
    JD:&nbsp;Allerdings verlässt nichts das Büro, hinter dem wir nicht beide stehen. Wenn Katharina findet, dass ein Entwurf gar nicht geht, wird er nicht rausgeschickt, auch wenn ich ihn liebe.

    How do you balance the conflict between
    economic efficiency and your own demands
    on the quality of design?
  category: Processes
  antwort: 'KW:&nbsp;Time is a big issue for us at the moment, because we have neglected a consistent time recording in the last two years. Meanwhile, we have realized how important this is in order to be able to assess the effort better. So far, the estimation and the actual expenditure of time have been very different, but since we have recorded it, we have become somewhat stricter. We do not necessarily work out yet another idea when we realize that we already exceeded the estimated hours.'

  frage: Do you actively go on acquisition?
  category: Processes
  antwort: |
    JD:&nbsp;So far, there was no need to actively acquire customers, which is quite astonishing. Especially since we do not want to work in advertising, but for customers from the social, political and cultural sectors. Our existing customers have always been able to generate new jobs.
    KW:&nbsp;What you should not underestimate is private acquisition, which we both do intuitively. Whenever you meet new people and talk about your profession and thereby offer graphic advice, this can often lead to new projects. We received the first orders from our circle of friends. Since about half a year we get orders that we cannot trace back.

    Do you deal with your process of
    designing for example by consciously
    working in an experimental or a
    conceptual way?
  category: Design
  antwort: |
    JD:&nbsp;Ich wäre gerne noch experimenteller, aber das ist eine Zeitfrage, die vom Budget abhängig ist. Ab und an muss man sich dazu zwingen, neue Dinge auszuprobieren und zum Beispiel das analoge Experiment weiter auszubauen.
    KW:&nbsp;Wir würden gerne einen Tag im Monat einführen, an dem wir neue Ansätze und Techniken ausprobieren oder Recherche betreiben können. Bisher fehlt dazu leider die Zeit. Aber natürlich betrachten wir jede/n Kund_in neu, analysieren seine/ihre Zielgruppen und passen die Design daran an.

    Do you want your signature to be
    recognized or is it fully about the
    commission?
  category: Approach
  antwort: |
    JD:&nbsp;It used to be a big issue to me, but it does not concern me anymore. In general, we have no particular style that we pursue. Rather, I consider every project to be a metamorphosis with the customer. Sometimes I come up with great ideas before I have to realize that the customer does not feel comfortable with it. Therefore, a project is rather a relationship with the customer, in which the outcome is like a common baby. Before the start of a project, however, we already carry out research in order to differentiate ourselves from similar projects.
    KW:&nbsp;I've also left this self-realization phase behind me. It was interesting one year after my studies, but that's not what I'm looking for now. We focus on a happy customer and that we are satisfied with the designs. There is no sense in producing »hot shit« that no one understands.

  frage: What do you think about design trends?
  category: Approach
  antwort: |
    JD:&nbsp;The focus should be on the project, but of course we want to use a good font and do not try to use a different design, just so that it is less hip. In Berlin you can hardly escape from trends, so I think that our design is pretty up-to-date.
    KW:&nbsp;The problem is that a trend must also be sold to the customer. Just because you find something hip and beautiful, does not mean that someone wants it.

  frage: Do you have any role models?
  category: Inspiration
  antwort: |
    KW:&nbsp;<a href="http://bureauborsche.com/">Mirko Borsche</a> still inspires me because I feel that he can do what he wants and every customer buys it. What I’m missing is a female role model and someone I can look up to entrepreneurially. We have made it ourselves and often it would have been nice to have a mentor, who can give advice. Perhaps a little bit more agency experience would have helped as well.
    JD:&nbsp;I have no specific person as a role model, but rather a certain inner attitude as a goal. My vision is to not let myself be stressed and to work on things with an inner balance. Self-employment is a strong challenge for the inner balance, so I hope to be like a little Buddha, who can keep his serenity and transfer it to clients.

    What does success mean to you
    personally?
  category: Success
  antwort: |
    JD:&nbsp;We've been thinking about that lot. Success for me is the realization that I am in a steady process and not just work on a goal ­ after all, you are constantly working on new jobs and it makes no sense to try to empty the to-do list. Understanding this process is a big task for me.
    KW:&nbsp;For me, success also means having fun at work and earning my livelihood. If you are constantly thinking about your financial balance, you have no fun. Being able to identify with the projects is important to me. I do not want to work for assholes.

    How important is public attention to
    you?
  category: Visibility
  antwort: |
    KW:&nbsp;The importance of public attention must not be underestimated, even though we are both not very good at it and often do not feel like working on it. Self-presentation also takes a lot of working hours, which can be exhausting. Men are often better at it, because of their big flap. Women are much more self-critical with their performance and therefore, could follow the men’s example.
    JD:&nbsp;I am always happy when someone acknowledges our work. At the same time, it is difficult for me to implement self-imposed measures consistently. For me, it's more of a burden to present my work on Facebook and Instagram.

    Did you ever experience any
    uncomfortable situation at work due to
    your sex?
  category: Equality
  antwort: |
    KW:&nbsp;Whenever we meet with a customer for the first time, we feel that there is some sort of mistrust regarding our performance, because we do not wear jackets and are not very big. At the beginning of a co-operation, there is often a sort of fake fight, in which we should prove ourselves, although we were specifically requested to do the job. This behavior could be partly attributed to our sex, but perhaps also to our appearance. Many men are much more self-assured and thereby have a different effect on the customer. You can convince customers quickly, but at the beginning you come across small barriers.
    I once worked in an office with two bosses who have only hired women. In retrospect, I feel that this is some sort of oppression—the hardworking women who are not pretentious.
    JD:&nbsp;In part, I also feel that I am not properly recognized as a consultant in the design process, but rather as a service provider. As long as the design is satisfactory, there are no complaints—but whenever there are questions or doubts, I am not perceived as a professional who can clarify these questions. This can also be due to the fact that many graphic designers work with a different self-understanding.
    At a Christmas party during an internship, someone told me that I only got the job because there is a video of me in which I eat a chocolate banana. This is already really sexist and was very shocking. It can be a naive strategy to play the sweet girl, but at some point you do not feel like it anymore.

    Do you think there are special
    challenges for women in the design
    field?
  category: Equality
  antwort: |
    KW:&nbsp;I think external circumstances are very difficult to change, so basically we only have the opportunity to work on ourselves. Perhaps it is a way to adapt one's own appearance and to present oneself as one would like to be perceived. I do not want to disguise myself at all, but I would like to try to be more confident when starting new projects.
    JD:&nbsp;In the existing economic system, you are often being taken advantage of as a sensitive person. If you do not build a protective wall against these harsh structures, your own character quickly collides with the system. For me, the key is to recognize your own limitations, communicate them and stick to them.

    How strictly do you separate work and
    private life?
  category: Private Life
  antwort: |
    KW:&nbsp;At the beginning we worked a lot—you think that for this a great project you could work also at the weekend, but then comes the next great project and the weekend work does not stop. After two years we were pretty drained and had to learn to stick to strict limits. Now there is an office telephone and e-mails are not read in the evenings and at the weekend. The flexible working hours are tempting with regard to mixing private life and work, but that is not good. I prefer to separate the time I work from the time I rest. These limits must also be made clear to the customer when suddenly he writes messages on Facebook or WhatsApp.
    JD:&nbsp;There is this romantic idea of self-realization in a creative profession in Berlin, but it is hard work, in which financial aspects are also important. At the beginning, I tried to work full-time, studying the Master, but that quickly brought me to my psychological and physical limits, which must be recognized and communicated.

    How difficult is it to enforce limits
    with clients?
  category: Spezifisch
  antwort: 'KW:&nbsp;The stress happens in the head. We have often seen that artificial pressure is built up by the customers. If you do not react on Saturday, the problem often solves itself by Monday. If you communicate clearly that you do not work at the weekend, it is usually accepted. We do not save lives with our work—normally no one cares whether the flyer is finished one day sooner or later.'

    Which professional or personal goals do
    you want to achieve?
  category: Future
  antwort: |
    KW:&nbsp;On the one hand we would like to continue working together and enjoy our freedom. On the other hand, it would be nice to hire someone to support us with projects. I think it does not make sense to set a firm goal, because ideas change again and again. It is better to have a vision.
    JD:&nbsp;Other than continuing to work together, we would like to keep our friendship alive, which has so far enriched us both. The financial independence is important to me, but otherwise I am very flexible. It would be great to be able to start a family at some point without having to worry about the financial.
    KW:&nbsp;Our main focus does not necessarily have to remain in graphic design, but could shift in a different direction, for example art direction.
