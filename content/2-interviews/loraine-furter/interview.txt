Introduction: As an educated graphic designer, Loraine Furter’s practice is now situated at the crossroads of art, design, editing and curating. Research is entirely part of her work, which combines hybrid, written and visual productions. Loraine Furter teaches at ERG in Brussels and is currently involved in the development of a master’s program on design and gender. She tells us about the changes in design education and why you should not be afraid to call yourself a feminist.
