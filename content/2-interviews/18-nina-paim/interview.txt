Currently she works on a long-term research project and organizes conferences, critically addressing the role of design in times of global transformation. In the interview she tells us about how she ended up working at the crossroads of design and research, how a womanâ€™s role changes in society as soon as she becomes a mother and how angry she is about blatant gender inequality in the design public.
