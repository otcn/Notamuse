Introduction: After her graduation and two years of agency life in Brighton, Michelle Phillips decided to move to Berlin to take the leap into independence. As Yukiko, she and Johannes Conrad provide creative direction, art direction and design for print, digital media and video, led by a hands-on approach, unlimited imagination and relevant ideas. We met the art director of Flaneur and Sofa Magazin, amongst others, and talked about her start in Berlin in 2012, her attitude towards beautiful and ugly design and the importance of working with nice people.
